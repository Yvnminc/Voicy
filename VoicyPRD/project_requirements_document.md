# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

Our project is a web-based voice app designed to let users record and organize voice memos much like Apple's Voice Memos. The app not only allows live recording and audio file uploads but also leverages Google’s streaming speech-to-text API to create real-time transcriptions. Users can then organize these recordings using a folder system, interact with an AI for meeting summarizations, and engage in chat-like follow-up queries about previous recordings. The overall goal is to provide an intuitive, efficient, and organized experience for managing voice content.

This app is being built to simplify how users manage their voice records and to offer enhanced functionalities like AI meeting summarization and interactive chats for deeper insights. Key objectives include delivering accurate and real-time transcription, an easy-to-navigate folder management system, and a seamless audio upload/download process. Success will be measured in the app’s performance, responsiveness, and overall user satisfaction, while keeping the interface clean, simple, and attractive with a black, red, and white color scheme inspired by Apple and ChatGPT designs.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Implementing a live audio recording feature that integrates with Google's streaming speech-to-text API.
*   Supporting audio file uploads (in MP3 format) with automatic transcription.
*   Creating a folder organization system for users to create and delete folders, allowing effective categorization of recordings.
*   Integrating an AI system to summarize transcribed text and provide an interactive chat interface for follow-up queries.
*   Developing a settings interface where users can control language configurations for transcription.
*   Ensuring the app is built as a web app with a modern design using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.
*   Utilizing Supabase for cloud-based audio storage and data management.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Multi-user authentication (the app is focused on a single-user experience without login systems).
*   Additional custom settings like transcription accuracy preferences or privacy controls beyond language settings.
*   Integrations with third-party services beyond Google’s speech-to-text API and the specified AI tools.
*   Development of native mobile or desktop versions; the current scope is limited to a web application.
*   Advanced security measures for recordings and transcriptions, as no specific policies are required at this stage.

## 3. User Flow

When a user lands on the web app, they are greeted with a clean, minimalist interface that emphasizes simplicity with a black, red, and white color scheme. The landing page clearly shows options to start a new recording or manage existing recordings organized into folders. The interface is designed to quickly guide the user to record a voice memo or upload an audio file, making it easy to see the immediate benefit of transcription and organization.

After initiating a voice memo recording or uploading an MP3 file, the user is taken to an interactive recording screen where the Google API processes the audio into text in real time. Once the transcription is complete, the app presents options for organizing the recording into folders, summarizing the meeting through the AI module, or downloading the audio. In the same space, users can interact with the AI chat interface to ask follow-up questions or retrieve context from previous recordings, ensuring the app remains intuitive from start to finish.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Live Voice Recording & Upload Capability:**\
    Ability to record voice memos live or upload pre-recorded MP3 files.

    Process transcriptions into concise meeting summaries and support an interactive chat interface for querying details and context from earlier recordings.
*   **Audio Management Module:**\
    Functionality for users to download audio recordings in MP3 format and manage uploads seamlessly.
*   **Settings Interface:**\
    Controls to adjust language settings for transcription, ensuring that the app meets user-specific linguistic needs.
*   **Clean, Minimalist Design:**\
    User interface inspired by Apple’s Voice Memos and ChatGPT with a color scheme of black, red, and white, providing clear and intuitive navigation.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   Next.js for building a modern, server-side rendered web application.
    *   Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with a focus on responsive design.
    *   TypeScript for writing strongly typed JavaScript code ensuring fewer runtime errors.
    *   Shadcn UI for pre-built, customizable UI components that match the modern design.

*   **Backend & Data Management:**

    *   Supabase as the cloud-based backend and database solution for audio storage and data handling.

*   **APIs & AI Integrations:**

    *   Google API for real-time speech-to-text transcription.
    *   Open AI (via GPT 4o) for AI-based meeting summarization and interactive chat capability.

*   **Development Tools:**

    *   Replit as an online IDE for coding and collaboration during development.
    *   GPT 4o as the primary AI model supporting technological implementation.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**\
    The transcription should occur in real time with minimal delay. The overall app responsiveness must be high, ensuring that load times are optimal on modern browsers.
*   **Security:**\
    While no advanced security measures are specified, the data stored in Supabase should follow standard practices for data integrity and secure access from the cloud.
*   **Compliance:**\
    Basic compliance with web standards to ensure the app works across modern browsers without specific regulatory constraints.
*   **Usability:**\
    The interface must be intuitive, echoing the simplicity of Apple’s Voice Memos and ChatGPT. Controls should be clear, and interactions should feel natural and consistent across the platform.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The project relies on Google’s API for speech-to-text conversion, so any rate limits or API changes may impact functionality.
    *   Audio storage and data management are dependent on Supabase; any downtime or changes in Supabase services might affect the app.
    *   The app is a web-based application only and does not include multi-user authentication or native mobile support in this version.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   The target user is using a modern web browser that supports advanced JavaScript and audio APIs.
    *   Users prefer a single-user experience without the need for account creation or complex login systems.
    *   The audio files will be in MP3 format, and users are comfortable with the basic options provided without additional security policies.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Limitations:**\
    Google’s speech-to-text API might impose rate limits or incur latency issues during peak usage. It’s advisable to monitor API usage and have fallback strategies in case of API downtime.
*   **Data Storage and Retrieval:**\
    Reliance on Supabase for cloud storage demands stable network connectivity. In scenarios of poor connectivity, the app’s performance in storing or retrieving recordings might be affected.
*   **Real-Time Transcription Accuracy:**\
    Variations in audio quality or background noise could affect transcription accuracy. Additional error handling and clarity prompts might be needed to improve the user experience.
*   **AI Summarization & Chat Interaction:**\
    Handling context for chat queries across multiple recordings might be challenging. Plan for scenarios where the AI might not correctly associate follow-up questions with previous recordings and consider guidelines for such interactions.
*   **UI Consistency Across Devices:**\
    While this is a web app, varying screen sizes and resolutions could affect the UI’s usability. Testing across multiple browsers and devices is recommended to ensure a consistent user experience.

This detailed PRD should serve as the blueprint for building the voice app. It covers every aspect from core functionality to potential challenges, ensuring that subsequent documents like tech stack details, UI guidelines, backend structures, and implementation plans can be derived with clear and unambiguous reference points.
