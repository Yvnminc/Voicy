# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a brand-new user visits the web application, they are greeted by a clean and minimalist landing page that reflects the simple style of Apple’s Voice Memos. Although the app is designed for single user use, the interface guides the user in a straightforward manner even without a formal sign-up process. If the app were extended to support authentication, the user would be able to create an account using email or social logins, and the interface would clearly indicate how to sign in, sign out, or recover a lost password. In our current design, the absence of a multi-user requirement means that users immediately engage with the core features from the landing page without distraction. 

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After landing on the main page, the user finds a simple yet functional dashboard that serves as the home base for all app functionalities. The screen features a header with the app’s name and important options, while navigation elements are integrated within a slim sidebar that helps the user move between recording audio, accessing stored voice memos, and managing folders. The design uses a consistent palette of black, red, and white to deliver a clear, focused look reminiscent of both Apple’s Voice Memos and ChatGPT. The dashboard provides easy access to core features such as live recording, uploading files, and automatically retrieving previously recorded memos organized by folders. 

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user starts an audio session from the landing page, they are offered a simple choice: record a new voice memo live or upload an existing MP3 audio file from their device. In the live recording mode, the application leverages Google’s streaming speech-to-text API, and the user immediately sees the transcription appearing on the screen as the recording progresses. If the user opts to upload an audio file, the app carries out a similar process, converting the pre-recorded audio into text and displaying it alongside the audio controls. Once the transcription process begins, the interface also presents options to pause, restart, or save the current session. 

After the recording is complete, the application automatically stores both the audio and the transcription using a cloud-based system with Supabase. At this point, the user is seamlessly transitioned to a new view where they can organize the memo. This is done through a folder management system that allows the creation and deletion of folders. The organization page is simple: users can create a new folder to categorize a meeting or idea, or select and delete folders that are no longer needed. The navigation between these pages is fluid; after organizing files, a user can return to the main dashboard at any time using clearly labeled navigation options.

For users who wish to gain insights from their recordings, the app offers an AI meeting summarization feature. Once the transcription is finalized, the user can invoke the AI summary tool to process the text and generate a concise overview of the meeting. Additionally, the interface supports an interactive chat feature, enabling users to ask follow-up questions about the content or review context from previous recordings. The chat experience is integrated directly within the recording view and makes it easy for users to interact with their stored data. In addition to these interactive functions, users are able to directly manage and download their audio files. A dedicated audio management area allows for downloading of memos in MP3 format and re-uploading if modifications or additional transcriptions are needed.

## Settings and Account Management
The settings section is designed to be straightforward and minimal while still offering critical customization options. Although the main focus is on controlling the language preference for transcription accuracy, other settings may be expanded in the future. On the settings page, the user can adjust which language is used during the transcription process by selecting from a dropdown menu or a similar simple interface. This page also includes a return option that clearly navigates the user back to the main dashboard once they have saved their preferences. While there is no detailed account management required for this single user experience, the structure is built in a way that could easily support additional settings or even multi-user authentication if needed in the future.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Throughout the application, clear error states and user-friendly messages are presented to handle any issues. If the user attempts to record or upload an invalid file type or an audio file with the wrong format, the system promptly displays an error message that informs them of the acceptable formats, specifically MP3. In situations where there is a loss of connectivity or the streaming speech-to-text service fails, the error messages appear directly on the active recording or upload page, suggesting that the user refresh or try the process again. Whenever an error occurs, the design ensures that the user always has a way back to the last known good state with easy access to the home dashboard or the recording page. This reliability keeps the overall experience smooth and ensures that users are not left in an uncertain state.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The app journey starts with a welcoming landing page where the user is introduced to a simple, clean interface styled in black, red, and white. From the very first interaction, the user has the choice to record a new voice memo live with real-time transcription using Google’s API or to upload a pre-recorded MP3 audio file. Once the audio is processed, the app stores both the audio and the text in the cloud, and the user is guided to organize their memos within a folder system. The journey continues as the user taps into AI-driven meeting summarization and an interactive chat feature that allows for detailed insights and follow-up questions. Audio management is seamlessly integrated, allowing for both downloads and uploads without additional complexity. The settings page, though focused mainly on language controls, typifies the clear and uncluttered approach taken throughout the app. In summary, the application delivers a straightforward, responsive, and engaging experience that takes the user from recording through organization and intelligent content summarization, all while maintaining a cohesive and user-friendly interface.
